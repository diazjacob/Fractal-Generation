# Fractal Generation
 A project created to explore fractals and how they're generated. 
 
 The core fractal that was explored was the classic [Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set), as well as the [Burning Ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Ship_fractal) fractal. Finally a modified fractal generation function is included to create associated [Julia sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set).

## Here are some generated images:

A simple Mandelbrot fractal, one of the most common fractals based on diverging complex sequences.

The Multibrot fractal. The Mandelbrot fractal is actually a special case of the multibrot where the complex power equals 2. Modifying this power gives us some much more chaotic and weird results.

One of the Mandelbrot's associated Julia sets. Created by modifying how we use our pixel position as complex function inputs. This julia set is considered to be "unstable" because small changes to the input parameters can drastically change the finished image.

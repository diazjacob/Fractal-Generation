# Fractal Generation
 A project created to explore fractals and how they're generated. 
 
 The core fractal that was explored was the classic [Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set), as well as the [Burning Ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Ship_fractal) fractal. Finally a modified fractal generation function is included to create associated [Julia sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set).
